biological computing exercise 1 questions 1,2

how to run:
q1: simply run the program. the program print the count for n=1 to n=4, and save files 'sub-graphs_n<#n>' (e.g. for n=1, 'sub-graphs_n1').
q2: graph input as a file 'q2_input.txt' with the following format:
    in each line write an edge like 'v1 v2', e.g. '1 2'. The vertices should be numbered from 1 to |V|.
    with a simple run, the program save result file 'q2_output.txt'.
